<P>All certificates from the database are displayed in a tree view reflecting
the chain dependencies.
If there is a CA certificate and several client certificates signed by this CA,
the client certificates can be shown by clicking on the plus sign of the CA certificate.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ca_cert"></A> <A NAME="ss9.1">9.1</A> <A HREF="xca.html#toc9.1">CA certificates </A>
</H2>


<P>XCA will recognize CA certificates if the CA flag in the <CODE>Basic Constraints</CODE>
is set to true.
If there is a corresponding private key, the <CODE>CA</CODE>
sub-menu in the context-menu will be enabled.</P>


<P>For building the chains the CA flag is disregarded, because there are some
CAs without this flag.
Instead it considers the issuer name and the signature to decide which certificate is the issuer.
In case of more than one possible issuer, the one with the latest
expiry date will be used as issuer to collect all issued certificates.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2</A> <A HREF="xca.html#toc9.2">Generating certificates</A>
</H2>


<P>After clicking on the <CODE>New Certificate</CODE> button the Certificate input dialog will be started to ask
all needed information for generating a new Certificate. See: 
<A HREF="xca-5.html#wizard">The Certificate input dialog</A>
Certificate creation can also be invoked by the context menu of the certificate list background
or by the context menu of the request.
In this case the Certificate input dialog is preset with the request to be signed.</P>


<P>If a <CODE>CA certificate</CODE> is selected in the certificate list, this
certificate will be preselected as issuing certificate.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.3">9.3</A> <A HREF="xca.html#toc9.3">Certificate details</A>
</H2>


<P>The signer is the internal name of the issuers certificate, <EM>SELF SIGNED</EM> if it is
self signed or <EM>SIGNER UNKNOWN</EM> if the issuer's certificate is not available.
The validity is set to <EM>valid</EM> if the certificate's dates are valid
or to <EM>Not valid</EM> if they are not, compared to the
internal time and date of the OS.</P>


<P>If the certificate is revoked, the revocation date will be shown instead.</P>


<P>On the <EM>Subject</EM> and <EM>Issuer</EM> tab the distinguished name is
also displayed in a format defined in RFC2253 for copy&amp;paste.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.4">9.4</A> <A HREF="xca.html#toc9.4">Certificate Export</A>

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Clipboard</B> Copy all selected certificates to the clipboard as PEM file</LI>
<LI><B>File</B> Export to external file.
The filename can be selected in the export dialog and the Export format:

<LI><B>Other token</B> Store certificate on any Security token</LI>
<LI><B>OpenSSL config</B> Create an OpenSSL config file from the content of this certificate, which can be used to generate a similar certificate with openssl (openssl req -new -x509 -config &lt;file&gt;)</LI>
</UL>
</P>


<P>When exporting PKCS#12 structures you are asked later for an encryption
password.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.5">9.5</A> <A HREF="xca.html#toc9.5">Certificate Transformation</A>
</H2>


<P>A certificate transformation creates a new database entry based on the selected certificate.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Public Key</B> Extract the public key from the certificate and store it in the Private Keys Tab.</LI>
<LI><B>Request</B> Create a PKCS#10 request by using the data from the certificate. The private key of the certificate must be available for this option.</LI>
<LI><B>Similar Certificate</B> Starts the Certificate input dialog preset with all values from the current certificate to create a new certificate.</LI>
<LI><B>Template</B> Create a XCA template with the values of the request.</LI>

</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.6">9.6</A> <A HREF="xca.html#toc9.6">Certificate revocation</A>
</H2>


<P>Certificates can only be revoked, if the private key of the issuer's certificate
is available. The certificate will be marked as revoked and the revocation date
and reason will be stored with the CA certificate.</P>
<P>If more than one unrevoked certificate of the same issuer is selected, all of them will be revoked
at once with the same revocation date and reason. The context menu shows this by adding
the number of selected certificates in squared brackets.</P>


<P>To generate a CRL, revoke the appropriate certificates and select CA->Generate CRL in the context-menu of the signing certificate.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.7">9.7</A> <A HREF="xca.html#toc9.7">Certificate renewal</A>
</H2>


<P>Certificates can only be renewed, if the private key of the issuer's certificate
is available. Renewal is done by creating a new certificate as a copy of the original one
with adjusted validity dates.</P>
<P>Use the <CODE>Revoke old certificate</CODE> check-box to automatically revoke the old
certificate.</P>
<P>If more than one certificate of the same issuer is selected, all of them will be renewed
at once with the same validity dates. The context menu shows this by adding
the number of selected certificates in squared brackets.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss9.8">9.8</A> <A HREF="xca.html#toc9.8">CA special functions</A>
</H2>


<P>The context menu of CA certificates contains the <EM>CA</EM> sub-menu,
which makes the following functions available:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Properties</B></LI>
<LI><B>Generate CRL</B> Generate the CRL by collecting all
revoked certificates and their revocation date.</LI>
<LI><B>Manage revocations</B> Displays all revocations and allows to manipulate them.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>CA Properties</H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>CRL days</B> The days until the next CRL release.</LI>
<LI><B>Signing Template</B> The default template for
issuing certificates.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H3>Manage revocations</H3>

<P>Non existing certificates may be revoked by adding the serial number of the certificate.
Since version 1.3.0 it is not required anymore to keep revoked certificates in the database,
because the revocation information is stored together with the CA certificate.</P>
