<P>For creating certificates, keys are needed.
All keys are stored encrypted in the database using the 3DES algorithm.
The password can be changed for each key. The password type means:
<UL>
<LI>common: The database password provided during database load</LI>
<LI>private: The key has its own password, which is not stored by XCA. This can be set and reset via the context menu of the key</LI>
<LI>PIN: Security tokens are usually protected by a PIN</LI>
<LI>No password: Public keys don't need a password</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>All keys carry a use counter which counts the times it is used.
When creating new
requests or certificates the list of available keys is reduced to
the keys with a use counter of 0. This can be overridden by the check-box
next to the key list.</P>

<P>When importing an EC key with explicit curve parameters,
the corresponding curve OID is searched and set if found.</P>

<P>When exporting the key via SQL from the database,
see 
<A HREF="xca-3.html#extract">Extracting items</A> openssl asks for the password,
which is either the database password or its own password in case the
password type is <CODE>private</CODE>.</P>

</H2>


<P>The dialog asks for the internal name of the key and the key-size in bits.
For EC keys, a list of curves is shown. It contains all X9.62 curves and many others.</P>


<P>EC Brainpool curves are also supported when linking with OpenSSL 1.0.2.</P>

<P>Even if the drop-down list only shows the most usual key sizes, any other value
may be set here by editing this box.
While searching for random prime numbers a progress bar is shown in the
bottom of the base application.
After the key generation is done the key will be stored in the database.</P>


<P>When checking the <CODE>Remember as default</CODE> box, the settings
(Key-type, key-size or EC curve) will be remembered and preset for the
next key generation dialog. This option is not available
when generating token keys.</P>


<P>For every connected token providing the Key-generate facility an entry in the
drop-down menu of the key-types will be shown.
It contains the name of the token and the valid key-sizes.</P>


<P>In case of EC keys generated on a token, the list of possible curves
is restricted based on informations provided by the token (Key size and FP/F2M).
The token may support even less ECParameters / OIDs. When selecting an EC curve
not supported by the token an error will occur.
Please consult the documentation of the provider of the PKCS#11 library.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2</A> <A HREF="xca.html#toc7.2">Key Export</A>
</H2>


<P>Keys can be exported by either selecting the key and pressing <EM>Export</EM>
or by using the context-menu.
It may be chosen to export the key to the clipboard as PEM public, SSH2 public
or unencrypted PEM private format.
In case of a file export a dialog-box opens where next to the filename one of the
following formats may be selected:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>PEM public</B> the public part of the key in PEM format</LI>
<LI><B>DER public</B> the public part of the key in DER format</LI>
<LI><B>SSH2 public</B> the public part of the key in SSH2 format</LI>
<LI><B>PEM private</B> the private key unencrypt in PEM format</LI>
<LI><B>PKCS#8 encrypted</B> the encrypted private key in PKCS#8 format</LI>
<LI><B>DER private</B> the private key in binary DER format</LI>
<LI><B>PEM encrypted</B> the private key in PEM format with an OpenSSL specific
extensions for encryption</LI>
<LI><B>PKCS#8 unencrypted</B> the private key unencrypted in PKCS#8 format</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The filename is the internal name plus a <CODE>pem</CODE>, <CODE>der</CODE>, <CODE>pk8</CODE> or <CODE>pub</CODE> suffix.
When changing the file-format, the suffix of the filename changes accordingly.
Only PKCS#8 or PEM files can be encrypted, because
the DER format (although it could be encrypted)
does not support a way to supply the encryption algorithm
like e.g. <CODE>DES</CODE>.
Of course, encryption does not make sense if the private part is not exported.</P>
