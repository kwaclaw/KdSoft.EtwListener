<P>This application is intended as certificate- and key-store and as
signing application issuing certificates.</P>

<P>All data structures (Keys, Certificate signing requests, Certificates and Templates)
can be imported and exported in several formats like DER or PEM.
Import means reading a file from the filesystem and storing the data structure
into the database file, while exporting means to write the data structure
from the database file to the filesystem to be imported into an other application.</P>

<P>When opening a new database the first time, it needs a password to encrypt the
private keys in the database. This is the default password. Every time this
database is opened the application asks for the password. This input dialog
may be canceled and the database is still opened successfully.
However, the access to the keys is not possible without supplying the
correct database password every time a key is used.</P>

<P>When setting an empty password, XCA will never ask again for a password
when opening this database. This can be useful when playing around with test certificates or if all private keys are on security tokens.</P>

<P>The database password can be changed by the Menu item <EM>Extra-&gt;Change DataBase password</EM></P>

<P>The different cryptographic parts are divided over 5 Tabs: Keys, Requests, Certificates, Templates and Revocation lists.
All items can be manipulated either by a context menu available by
right-clicking on the item, or by using the buttons at the right border.
Every item is identified by an internal name which
is always shown in the first column as long as the columns are not reordered by the user.</P>
